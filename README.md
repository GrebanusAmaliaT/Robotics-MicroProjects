## Homework 4 - Simon Says

### Task Requirements

Design and implement a Simon Says memory game using a 4-digit 7-segment display driven by a 74HC595 shift register, a joystick for control, a buzzer for audio feedback, and an extra push button for the pause/menu function.

The game displays a sequence of 4 digits that the player must memorize and reproduce correctly using the joystick. Each round gets progressively faster.

### Components

- Component	Quantity	Description
- 74HC595 Shift Register	1	Drives the 7-segment segments
- 4-Digit 7-Segment Display	1	Common Anode display (documented below)
- Joystick with Push Button	1	X, Y, and SW used for input
- Buzzer	1	Non-blocking sound feedback
- Push Button	1	Pause/Menu function
- Resistors & Wiring	as needed	Segment current-limiting and pull-downs

### Pin Map

- Function	Arduino Pin	Notes
- 74HC595 LATCH	11	Controls output register
- 74HC595 CLOCK	10	Shifts bits
- 74HC595 DATA	12	Serial data in
- Digit Select Pins	4, 5, 6, 7	Control the 4 digits (multiplexed)
- Joystick X	A0	Horizontal movement
- Joystick Y	A1	Vertical movement
- Joystick SW	8	Push button (active LOW, internal pull-up)
- Pause/Menu Button	2	Active LOW (connected to GND)
- Buzzer	9	Non-blocking tone output

### System Behavior Summary

In the Idle/Menu state, the 4-digit display cycles between the options PLAy, SCOR, StOP, and HELP.
The player navigates using the joystick, and a short tick sound is heard every time the selection changes.

During the ShowSequence phase, a random 4-digit sequence is displayed on the screen for a limited time T milliseconds, which decreases with each successful round to increase difficulty.

In the InputPhase, the player re-enters the displayed digits using the joystick.
The currently active digit blinks fast (4 Hz), while locked digits blink slowly (1 Hz), giving clear visual feedback about the editing state.

In the CheckAnswer stage, the program compares the user’s input with the generated sequence.
If correct, a success tone is played and the score increases; otherwise, an error tone is emitted.

The Result state briefly displays either the updated score or Err on the display, before automatically returning to the main menu.

Finally, pressing the Pause/Menu button at any time during gameplay shows PAUS on the display.
After approximately 1.2 seconds, the game exits the paused state and returns safely to the main menu.

### Controls
Action	Input	Description
Move cursor	Joystick LEFT / RIGHT	Select active digit (0–3)
Edit digit	Joystick UP / DOWN	Change current digit value (0–9)
Lock/unlock	Short press (SW)	Lock/unlock current digit
Submit answer	Long press (SW)	Confirm all digits
Pause/Menu	Push button (pin 2)	Shows “PAUS” and returns to menu

### Display Texts (4-digit messages)
Menu – Play =	PLAy
Menu – Score =SCOR
Menu – Stop	= StOP
Menu – Help	= HELP (H custom character)
During pause = PAUS
Wrong answer = Err
Show score = Numeric value
Game idle	= Current menu item

### Buzzer Feedback
- Event	Sound
- Cursor move	Tick (short 2kHz beep)
- Lock/unlock digit	Click (1.5kHz, 80ms)
- Success	Success jingle (2.2kHz, 200ms)
- Error	Low tone (400Hz, 400ms)

All buzzer sounds are non-blocking using millis() control logic.

### Font Table (Segment Encoding)

| Character | Bitmask (ABCDEFG.) |
|------------|--------------------|
| 0 | `0b11111100` |
| 1 | `0b01100000` |
| 2 | `0b11011010` |
| 3 | `0b11110010` |
| 4 | `0b01100110` |
| 5 | `0b10110110` |
| 6 | `0b10111110` |
| 7 | `0b11100000` |
| 8 | `0b11111110` |
| 9 | `0b11110110` |
| A | `0b11101110` |
| C | `0b10011100` |
| E | `0b10011110` |
| L | `0b00011100` |

| P | `0b11001110` |
| R | `0b00001010` |
| S | `0b10110110` |
| t | `0b00011110` |
| U | `0b01111100` |
| y | `0b01110110` |
| H (custom) | `0b01101110` |
| Space | `0b00000000` |

Reasoning:
Characters chosen for best readability on 7-segment displays (e.g., “y” instead of “Y”, “t” lowercase for clarity).

### Timing and Difficulty
- Parameter	Default	Description
- Initial sequence display time	5000 ms	Time digits are visible
- Decrease per round	1500 ms	Faster difficulty scaling
- Minimum display time	800 ms	Fastest speed possible

Timing is handled entirely using millis() — no delay() calls are used anywhere.

### State Diagram

The state machine below illustrates the logical flow of the Simon Says game.

stateDiagram --> IdleMenu
    IdleMenu --> MenuAction : Select option
    MenuAction --> ShowSequence : Start game
    ShowSequence --> InputPhase : Time expired
    InputPhase --> CheckAnswer : Long press
    CheckAnswer --> Result
    Result --> IdleMenu : After delay
    ShowSequence --> Paused : Pause button
    InputPhase --> Paused : Pause button
    Paused --> IdleMenu : After 1.2s

### Wiring Diagram

Below is the wiring schematic of the Simon Says game circuit.
It includes the 74HC595 shift register, 4-digit 7-segment display, joystick, buzzer, and pause button.

| Component | Pin Connection | Description |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 74HC595 (Data) | 12 | Serial data input |
| 74HC595 (Clock) | 10 | Shift clock |
| 74HC595 (Latch) | 11 | Storage register clock |
| 4-Digit Display | Pins 4–7 | Digit enable control (multiplexed) |
| Joystick X | A0 | Horizontal movement |
| Joystick Y | A1 | Vertical movement |
| Joystick SW | 8 | Push button (with internal pull-up) |
| Buzzer | 9 | Audio feedback output |
| Pause/Menu Button | 2 | Game pause and menu trigger |
| Power | 5V / GND | Common circuit power |

### Blink Semantics
- Mode	Blink rate	Description
- Selected digit	4 Hz (~125 ms on/off)	Fast blink
- Locked digit	1 Hz (~500 ms on/off)	Slow blink
- Inactive digit	Steady ON	No blink

### Multiplex Display Control

- The 4-digit 7-segment display is driven using time-multiplexing:
- Only one digit is active at any time.
- Refresh frequency ≈ 500 Hz, imperceptible to the eye.
- Implemented via the non-blocking updateDisplayMultiplex() function.

### Audio Feedback Implementation

- All buzzer tones use tone(pin, freq) and are automatically stopped using millis() timers.
This ensures non-blocking behavior even during input or display transitions.

### Code Architecture

- updateStateIdleMenu() → handles joystick navigation and selection.
- updateStateShowSequence() → displays the memory sequence.
- updateStateInputPhase() → processes joystick inputs and blinking digits.
- updateStateCheckAnswer() → verifies the sequence.
- updateStateResult() → handles result logic (success/fail).
- updateStatePaused() → displays “PAUS” then returns to menu.
- updateDisplayMultiplex() → manages digit refresh.
- playTickSound(), playClickSound(), playSuccessSound(), playErrorSound() → buzzer feedback functions.
 
### Notes

- The system uses INPUT_PULLUP for all buttons (active LOW).
- Debouncing for joystick and menu inputs uses millis().
- No delay() is used anywhere.
- Game difficulty increases after each round.
- Code fully non-blocking and modular.

## Homework 3 - Home Alarm System

### Task Requirements
Design and implement an Arduino-based home alarm system that uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and a photoresistor (LDR) to detect intrusions or changes in the environment.
The system can be armed, disarmed, and configured through a Serial Monitor menu.
When armed, it continuously monitors the environment and triggers an alarm if a movement or a sudden distance variation is detected.

### Implementation Details
The circuit consists of:
1 × Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) connected to pins Trig = 6, Echo = 7
1 × Photoresistor (LDR) connected to A0
1 × Buzzer connected to pin 5
1 × Red LED (alarm indicator) on pin 10
1 × Green LED (disarmed indicator) on pin 11
Resistors and jumper wires as needed

### Functional description:

#### When powered on, the system:
- Initializes the Serial Monitor and prints a welcome message with the system name.
- Automatically calibrates the ultrasonic sensor by taking several distance readings to establish a baseline (“normal” distance).
- Enters the Disarmed state by default, indicated by the green LED.
- Displays the Main Menu for user interaction through the Serial Monitor.
- System Menu (via Serial Monitor)

#### If Disarmed:
Arm System – manually arms the alarm.
The system enters a 3-second arming phase before becoming active.
Settings / Configuration – opens a submenu that allows parameter adjustment.
Test Alarm – manually activates the alarm for testing purposes.

#### Settings Submenu:
1. Set Ultrasonic Sensitivity (distantaMax)
Defines the distance variation threshold (in cm) that triggers the alarm when exceeded.
2. Set LDR Light Threshold (pragLDR)
Sets the light level under which the system arms automatically (“night mode”).
3. Set Buzzer Frequency (buzzerFrecventa)
Changes the pitch of the alarm sound (in Hz).
4. Change Password
Requires entering the current password before setting a new one.
5. Change System Name
Updates the displayed name at startup.
6. Return to Main Menu

#### If Armed:
The system continuously monitors both sensors.
If a significant distance change is detected by the ultrasonic sensor, or the light level is below threshold, the system:
Warns of a possible intrusion.
Prompts the user to enter the password within 3 seconds.
If the password is correct → Disarm system.
If incorrect or not entered → Trigger alarm (buzzer + red LED blinking).

### System Behavior Summary
| State                            | Description                                                                              | Indicators                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Dezarmat (Disarmed)**          | System inactive. User can arm manually or wait for dark conditions to arm automatically. | Green LED ON                |
| **SeArmeaza (Arming)**           | 3-second countdown before activation.                                                    | Green LED blinking          |
| **Armat (Armed)**                | System actively monitors distance and light sensors.                                     | LEDs off, silent            |
| **PregatitDeActivare (Warning)** | Intrusion detected. Waits for password for 3 seconds.                                    | Serial Monitor prompt       |
| **AlarmaActiva (Alarm)**         | Alarm triggered (sound + red LED blinking).                                              | Red LED flashing, buzzer-ON |


### Code Structure and Style
The program is written in modular form, using clear functions for each subsystem:
- masurareDistanta() – reads the ultrasonic sensor and returns distance in centimeters.
- setareUltrasonic() – performs automatic calibration at startup.
- checkSensors() – reads both sensors and updates system state.
- handleMenu() – manages user interaction in the main menu.
- handleSettingsMenu() – manages the configuration submenu.
- handlePassword() – verifies and validates entered passwords.
- updateAlarm() – controls buzzer and red LED blinking when alarm is active.
- afisareMeniu() and afisareSubmeniuSetari() – display menu text and structure.

All time control is handled using millis() for non-blocking delays, ensuring continuous sensor monitoring and responsive menu navigation.

### System Logic Flow
- Startup & Calibration
The system averages multiple ultrasonic readings to set an initial reference distance.
- Disarmed Mode
The green LED stays ON; if light drops below the pragLDR value, the system arms automatically.
- Arming Delay (3 seconds)
Gives the user time to leave before activation.
- Monitoring Phase
If distance variation > distantaMax, the system waits for a password.
- Password Window (3 seconds)
If password not entered or incorrect → alarm activates.
- Alarm State
Buzzer emits sound at buzzerFrecventa; red LED blinks until the correct password is entered.
- Disarm
Stops buzzer, turns off red LED, turns on green LED, and returns to idle state.

## Sistem Feedback
Serial Monitor provides all interactions and confirmations:
- “Sistemul a fost armat.”
- “SPY CAT a detectat un posibil intrus! Introduceti parola.”
- “Parola corecta. Sistem dezarmat.”
- “Parola gresita – alarma activata!”
<br>
Invalid commands in the menu trigger clear messages and re-display of the available options.

## Homework 2 – Traffic Lights System

### Task Requirements
Design and implement an Arduino-based traffic light control system for a pedestrian crosswalk. The system coordinates the behavior of two traffic lights: one for cars and one for pedestrians. It uses a push button to request pedestrian crossing, a buzzer for auditory feedback, and a 7-segment display to show countdown timers. The transition between traffic light states must follow the specified sequence and timing, using non-blocking logic with millis() instead of delay().

### Implementation Details

#### The circuit consists of:

- Three LEDs for vehicles: red, yellow, and green, connected to digital pins 10, 9, and 8 respectively.
- Two LEDs for pedestrians: red and green, connected to pins 3 and 5.
- One push button (pin 2) for pedestrians to request a crossing. The button is configured with an internal pull-up resistor and handled using an interrupt that sets a flag when pressed.
- One buzzer (pin 6) that provides auditory cues during the pedestrian crossing phases.
- A 7-segment display, connected through pins 7, 4, 11, 12, 13, A5, A4, and A3, which shows countdown values during the timed states.

#### The program is structured as a finite state machine with four main states:

1. Idle State (Default)
Cars: green, Pedestrians: red
Buzzer: off
Duration: indefinite — waits for a valid button press.
The display is cleared or can remain off.

2. Transition State (Yellow Light)
Begins 8 seconds after a valid button press.
Cars: yellow, Pedestrians: red
Buzzer: off
Duration: 3 seconds
Countdown shown on the 7-segment display.

3. Pedestrian Green State (Crossing Allowed)
Cars: red, Pedestrians: green
Duration: 8 seconds
Countdown shown on the display.
The buzzer emits slow beeps (1 Hz) to signal the crossing time.

4. Warning State (Blinking Green)
Cars: red, Pedestrians: blinking green
Duration: 4 seconds
Countdown shown on the display.
Buzzer emits rapid beeps (~3 Hz) to warn that the crossing time is ending.
After this state, the system automatically returns to Idle.

All timing is managed using the millis() function to ensure non-blocking behavior. 
This allows accurate countdown display and real-time responsiveness to transitions. 
The interrupt service routine (ISR) attached to the button pin detects falling edges, 
setting a flag to initiate the state sequence only if the system is in the Idle state.

### Code Structure and Style

The program defines clear constants for all pin assignments and timing values. Descriptive variable names such as se_face_galben, se_face_rosu, and warning indicate each active phase. Modular functions handle specific subtasks:

- afisareNumaratoare() – displays digits on the 7-segment module.
- stergereNumaratoare() – clears the display.
- idle() – resets the system to its default state.
- se_apasa_butonul() – interrupt function for button press detection.

The logic in loop() continuously checks time differences using millis() to transition smoothly between states. No delay() is used, ensuring responsiveness and correct timing.

### System Behavior Summary
- When the system starts, vehicles have a green light and pedestrians a red light. Pressing the pedestrian button triggers a timed sequence:
- After 8 seconds, the vehicle light turns yellow for 3 seconds.
- Vehicles then stop, and pedestrians get a green light with a slow buzzer and countdown.
- The pedestrian green light begins blinking and the buzzer speeds up for 4 seconds.
- Finally, the system resets to its initial idle state.

## Homework 1 - RGB LED Control with 3 Potentiometers

### Task Requirements

Create an Arduino circuit and program that controls an RGB LED using three potentiometers — one for each color component (red, green, and blue). Each potentiometer should adjust the brightness of its respective color, allowing the LED to display any color combination.

The potentiometer values must be read through analog inputs and mapped to the 0–255 range required by the PWM output. The implementation should use clear variable names and constants instead of “magic numbers,” and the code must follow proper formatting and consistent style.

### Implementation details 
The circuit uses three potentiometers connected to the analog pins A0, A1 and A2 of the Arduino UNO. Each potentiometer controls one color channel of a common-cathode RGB LED, whose red, green, and blue pins are connected through appropriate resistors to PWM-enabled digital pins 9, 10 and 11.

The Arduino program continuously reads the analog voltage from each potentiometer, then maps those readings from the input range 0–1023 to the PWM output range 0–255 using the map() function. The resulting values are written to the LED pins with analogWrite(), which adjusts the intensity of each color channel. By varying the three potentiometers, the user can mix colors in real time to produce the full RGB spectrum.

All numerical constants, such as the maximum analog or PWM values, are defined at the beginning of the code for readability and precision. The sketch maintains consistent indentation, descriptive variable names, and comments explaining each step, following the provided style guide.
