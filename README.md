# Project 5 - LCD Platformer: Dangerous Love

This project aimed to design and implement a side-scrolling platformer game on a 16x2 LCD display, using Clean Architecture principles to ensure a clear separation of concerns. The system is structured around a GameModel for game logic, a GameController for handling input and updates, and an IRenderer interface to decouple rendering from the game state.”

### Implementation Details

* **Procedural Generation:** The `generateMap()` function creates a new 100-tile world each round. It uses `random()` to place enemies (1) and hearts (2), ensuring the first 5 tiles are always safe for spawning.
* **Floating Point Physics:** The player's X position is stored as a `float` (incremented by 0.5). This allows for smoother internal logic calculation, which is then cast to `int` for grid rendering.
* **Camera Logic:** The camera window (16 chars) does not lock strictly to the player. It uses a "dead zone" approach: the camera only scrolls forward if the player moves past the 8th column relative to the screen, and scrolls back if the player retreats too close to the left edge.
* **Smart Rendering:** The `drawGame` function iterates only through the 16 columns currently visible based on `cameraX`. It calculates the offset into the global `mapData` matrix, ensuring efficiency.
* **Non-Blocking UI & Audio:** All sounds and delays are handled via `millis()`. For example, the "SCORE RESET!" message uses a state-based timer (`resetTimer`) to hold the message on screen for 2 seconds without using `delay()`, allowing the processor to continue running background tasks.

### Features 

For this project I have implemented multiple bonus features

* **Clean Architecture & Dual Rendering (Section 5.6 Bonus):**
    * Implemented a flexible **IRenderer interface**.
    * Created two concrete renderers: `LCDRenderer` (for gameplay) and `SerialRenderer` (for debugging and game logic verification via Serial Monitor without a display). This strictly enforces the Separation of Concerns principle.

* **Menu Complexity & About Section:**
    * Implemented a nested **Settings Menu** accessible via the Pause button.
    * Added an **About Section** displaying the creator's name and game info.
    * The Main Menu is dynamic, cycling through 4 different titles (`~Dangerous Love~`, `~ No FAKE love ~`, `~ Hearts Thief ~`, `~ Run FAST Run ~`) to keep the UI active.

* **Reset Highscore Option:**
    * Included a functional "Reset Score" option within the Settings menu that clears the EEPROM memory (sets top scores to 0) and provides visual/audio feedback.

* **Animations and Sound:**
    * **Love Animation:** A dedicated cutscene when the player collides with the enemy (hearts appear, game pauses).
    * **Audio Feedback:** Distinct sounds for Menu Navigation, Selection, Jumping, and Collecting items.
    * **Musical Sequence:** A rising scale melody plays during the "Love Animation" sequence.
    * **Slide Transitions:** The Game Over screen is not static; it automatically cycles through slides (Message -> Score -> Instructions).

* **Extra Logic & Game Complexity:**
    * **Character Selection:** Added a pre-game state where the player selects their avatar (Boy or Girl). This logic fundamentally changes the sprites: the unselected character becomes the in-game enemy.
    * **Camera Physics:** Implemented a "soft follow" camera that tracks the player smoothly (updates when player moves >8 tiles right or <2 tiles left).

* **Creative Theme:**
    * Instead of a standard "Death", the game over state is thematically integrated as "Falling in love" (colliding with the partner), turning a hazard into a narrative element.

### Components

| Component | Quantity | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Arduino Uno | 1 | Microcontroller |
| 16x2 LCD (HD44780) | 1 | Main display |
| Joystick Module | 1 | X/Y Analog + Switch |
| Push Button | 1 | Pause/Back function |
| Passive Buzzer | 1 | Audio feedback |
| Potentiometer | 1 | LCD Contrast control |
| Resistors | As needed | Current limiting |

### System Behavior Summary

Upon booting, the game enters the **Character Selection** state (`< GIRL >` vs `< BOY >`). The choice determines the player sprite and the enemy sprite.

In the **Idle/Menu** state, the display cycles through the top 3 high scores from EEPROM and the dynamic game titles.
During the **Gameplay**, the player navigates a procedurally generated map (100 tiles). The camera implements a "soft follow" mechanic, scrolling the world when the character moves past the center.

* **Objective:** Reach the finish line (Tile 100) while collecting Hearts.
* **Hazards:** Colliding with the "partner" (enemy) triggers the **Love Animation** (a rising tone sequence + visual hearts), resulting in Game Over.

The **Physics Engine** handles gravity. A jump moves the player to the top row for ~1.5 seconds before gravity pulls them back.

The **Settings Menu** allows the user to reset stored scores or view credits. The **Pause** button can be used to pause the game or as a "Back" button in menus.

### Controls

| Action | Input | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Move Left/Right | Joystick LEFT / RIGHT | Moves character horizontally |
| Jump | Joystick UP | Jumps to the top row (gravity applied) |
| Menu Navigate | Joystick UP / DOWN | Select settings options |
| Confirm / Start | Joystick Button (SW) | Confirm selection / Start Game |
| Pause Game | Button (Pin 10) | Toggles Pause state |
| Back | Button (Pin 10) | Return from Settings/About to Menu |
| Reset Score | Joystick Button (SW) | Inside Settings -> Reset option |

### Display Texts & UI

* **Menu:** Cycles Highscores (`1st`, `2nd`, `3rd`) and Titles.
* **Pause:** `!! PAUSED !!` / `Press to Resume`.
* **Win Screen:** `Level Completed!` / `No toxic love`.
* **Lose Screen:** `Game over! :(` / `You fell in love`.
* **Settings:** `> Reset Score` / `> About Section`.
* **Reset:** `SCORE RESET!` (Visible for 2 seconds).
  
### Architecture & SoC
The code follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern:

1.  **GameModel:** Holds the state (player position `float x, y`, map data, score, state enums). It is completely decoupled from hardware.
2.  **IRenderer (Interface):** An abstract class defining methods like `drawGame`, `drawMenu`.
    * **LCDRenderer:** Concrete implementation for the 16x2 screen.
    * **SerialRenderer:** Implementation for debugging via Serial Monitor.
3.  **GameController:** Bridges Input and Model. Handles the game loop, timers (`millis`), physics calculations, and updates the view.
### EEPROM Memory Map

The top 3 high scores are stored in the EEPROM. If the values are invalid (garbage data), they are initialized to 0.

| Address | Data | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0x00 - 0x01 | `int` (2 bytes) | 1st Place Score |
| 0x02 - 0x03 | `int` (2 bytes) | 2nd Place Score |
| 0x04 - 0x05 | `int` (2 bytes) | 3rd Place Score |

# Project 4 - Simon Says Game

This project aimed to design and implement a Simon Says memory game using a 4-digit 7-segment display driven by a 74HC595 shift register, a joystick for control, a buzzer for audio feedback, and an additional push button for pause and menu functions. The game displays a sequence of four digits that the player must memorize and reproduce using the joystick, with each round becoming progressively faster.

# Project 3 - Home Alarm System

This project aimed to design and implement an Arduino-based home alarm system using an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and a photoresistor (LDR) to detect intrusions or environmental changes. The system can be armed, disarmed, and configured through a Serial Monitor menu. When armed, it continuously monitors the surroundings and triggers an alarm if movement or sudden distance changes are detected.

### Video
https://youtube.com/shorts/A0DlVpqmwFQ?feature=share

<br>

### Implementation Details
The circuit consists of:
1 × Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) connected to pins Trig = 6, Echo = 7
1 × Photoresistor (LDR) connected to A0
1 × Buzzer connected to pin 5
1 × Red LED (alarm indicator) on pin 10
1 × Green LED (disarmed indicator) on pin 11
Resistors and jumper wires as needed

### Functional description:

#### When powered on, the system:
- Initializes the Serial Monitor and prints a welcome message with the system name.
- Automatically calibrates the ultrasonic sensor by taking several distance readings to establish a baseline (“normal” distance).
- Enters the Disarmed state by default, indicated by the green LED.
- Displays the Main Menu for user interaction through the Serial Monitor.
- System Menu (via Serial Monitor)

#### If Disarmed:
- Arm System – manually arms the alarm.
- The system enters a 3-second arming phase before becoming active.
- Settings / Configuration – opens a submenu that allows parameter adjustment.
- Test Alarm – manually activates the alarm for testing purposes.

#### If Armed:
- The system continuously monitors both sensors.
- If a significant distance change is detected by the ultrasonic sensor, or the light level is below threshold, the system:
-> Warns of a possible intrusion.
-> Prompts the user to enter the password within 3 seconds.
-> If the password is correct → Disarm system.
-> If incorrect or not entered → Trigger alarm (buzzer + red LED blinking).

### System Behavior Summary
| State                            | Description                                                                              | Indicators                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Dezarmat (Disarmed)**          | System inactive. User can arm manually or wait for dark conditions to arm automatically. | Green LED ON                |
| **SeArmeaza (Arming)**           | 3-second countdown before activation.                                                    | Green LED blinking          |
| **Armat (Armed)**                | System actively monitors distance and light sensors.                                     | LEDs off, silent            |
| **PregatitDeActivare (Warning)** | Intrusion detected. Waits for password for 3 seconds.                                    | Serial Monitor prompt       |
| **AlarmaActiva (Alarm)**         | Alarm triggered (sound + red LED blinking).                                              | Red LED flashing, buzzer-ON |


### Code Structure and Style
The program is written in modular form, using clear functions for each subsystem:
- masurareDistanta() – reads the ultrasonic sensor and returns distance in centimeters.
- setareUltrasonic() – performs automatic calibration at startup.
- checkSensors() – reads both sensors and updates system state.
- handleMenu() – manages user interaction in the main menu.
- handleSettingsMenu() – manages the configuration submenu.
- handlePassword() – verifies and validates entered passwords.
- updateAlarm() – controls buzzer and red LED blinking when alarm is active.
- afisareMeniu() and afisareSubmeniuSetari() – display menu text and structure.

All time control is handled using millis() for non-blocking delays, ensuring continuous sensor monitoring and responsive menu navigation.

## Sistem Feedback
Serial Monitor provides all interactions and confirmations:
- “Sistemul a fost armat.”
- “SPY CAT a detectat un posibil intrus! Introduceti parola.”
- “Parola corecta. Sistem dezarmat.”
- “Parola gresita – alarma activata!”
<br>
Invalid commands in the menu trigger clear messages and re-display of the available options.

# Project 2 – Traffic Lights System

This project aimed to design and implement an Arduino-based traffic light control system for a pedestrian crosswalk. 
The system manages two traffic lights—one for cars and one for pedestrians—and uses a push button to request crossing, a buzzer for audio feedback, and a 7-segment display to show countdown timers. 
The traffic light transitions follow a defined sequence and timing, implemented using non-blocking logic with millis() instead of delay().

<br>

### Implementation Details

#### The circuit consists of:

- Three LEDs for vehicles: red, yellow, and green, connected to digital pins 10, 9, and 8 respectively.
- Two LEDs for pedestrians: red and green, connected to pins 3 and 5.
- One push button (pin 2) for pedestrians to request a crossing. The button is configured with an internal pull-up resistor and handled using an interrupt that sets a flag when pressed.
- One buzzer (pin 6) that provides auditory cues during the pedestrian crossing phases.
- A 7-segment display, connected through pins 7, 4, 11, 12, 13, A5, A4, and A3, which shows countdown values during the timed states.

#### The program is structured as a finite state machine with four main states:

1. Idle State (Default)
Cars: green, Pedestrians: red
Buzzer: off
Duration: indefinite — waits for a valid button press.
The display is cleared or can remain off.

2. Transition State (Yellow Light)
Begins 8 seconds after a valid button press.
Cars: yellow, Pedestrians: red
Buzzer: off
Duration: 3 seconds
Countdown shown on the 7-segment display.

3. Pedestrian Green State (Crossing Allowed)
Cars: red, Pedestrians: green
Duration: 8 seconds
Countdown shown on the display.
The buzzer emits slow beeps (1 Hz) to signal the crossing time.

4. Warning State (Blinking Green)
Cars: red, Pedestrians: blinking green
Duration: 4 seconds
Countdown shown on the display.
Buzzer emits rapid beeps (~3 Hz) to warn that the crossing time is ending.
After this state, the system automatically returns to Idle.

All timing is managed using the millis() function to ensure non-blocking behavior. 
This allows accurate countdown display and real-time responsiveness to transitions. 
The interrupt service routine (ISR) attached to the button pin detects falling edges, 
setting a flag to initiate the state sequence only if the system is in the Idle state.

### Code Structure and Style

The program defines clear constants for all pin assignments and timing values. Descriptive variable names such as se_face_galben, se_face_rosu, and warning indicate each active phase. Modular functions handle specific subtasks:

- afisareNumaratoare() – displays digits on the 7-segment module.
- stergereNumaratoare() – clears the display.
- idle() – resets the system to its default state.
- se_apasa_butonul() – interrupt function for button press detection.

The logic in loop() continuously checks time differences using millis() to transition smoothly between states. No delay() is used, ensuring responsiveness and correct timing.

### System Behavior Summary
- When the system starts, vehicles have a green light and pedestrians a red light. Pressing the pedestrian button triggers a timed sequence:
- After 8 seconds, the vehicle light turns yellow for 3 seconds.
- Vehicles then stop, and pedestrians get a green light with a slow buzzer and countdown.
- The pedestrian green light begins blinking and the buzzer speeds up for 4 seconds.
- Finally, the system resets to its initial idle state.

# Project 1 - RGB LED Control with 3 Potentiometers

This project aimed to create an Arduino-based circuit and program to control an RGB LED using three potentiometers, one for each color component (red, green, and blue). Each potentiometer adjusts the brightness of its corresponding color, allowing the LED to display a wide range of color combinations. The analog input values are mapped to the 0–255 range required for PWM output, and the implementation uses clear variable names, constants, and consistent code formatting.

### Implementation details 
The circuit uses three potentiometers connected to the analog pins A0, A1 and A2 of the Arduino UNO. Each potentiometer controls one color channel of a common-cathode RGB LED, whose red, green, and blue pins are connected through appropriate resistors to PWM-enabled digital pins 9, 10 and 11.

The Arduino program continuously reads the analog voltage from each potentiometer, then maps those readings from the input range 0–1023 to the PWM output range 0–255 using the map() function. The resulting values are written to the LED pins with analogWrite(), which adjusts the intensity of each color channel. By varying the three potentiometers, the user can mix colors in real time to produce the full RGB spectrum.

All numerical constants, such as the maximum analog or PWM values, are defined at the beginning of the code for readability and precision. The sketch maintains consistent indentation, descriptive variable names, and comments explaining each step, following the provided style guide.
